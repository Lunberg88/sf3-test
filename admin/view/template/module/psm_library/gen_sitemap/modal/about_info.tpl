	<p>
	As you know, if you have more then 1500 products, Opencart can't generate sitemap, because your server will overload, and the time for generate can be more 20 sec. Also, Google can't wait so long and your sitemap couldn't be uploaded to Google. This module solves all this issue and gives you much more for the improve your SEO.
